The code provided does not use any third-party libraries or functions specifically for URL shortening. Instead, it implements its own URL shortening logic. Here is a breakdown of how it works:

1. Key Components:

    1.1 Dependencies and Configuration:

        1.1.1 Flask: A micro web framework for Python.
        1.1.2 Flask_SQLAlchemy: Adds SQLAlchemy support to Flask applications.
        1.1.3 Flask_Login: Manages user sessions in Flask.
        1.1.4 Flask_Migrate: Handles database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic.
        1.1.5 Werkzeug: Provides password hashing utilities.

    1.2 Database Models:

        1.2.1 User: Represents the users in the system.
        1.2.2 URL: Represents the URLs being shortened.

    1.3 URL Shortening Logic:

        1.3.1 generate_short_url(id): Generates a short URL based on the given id using a custom base conversion algorithm.
        1.3.2 insert_url(long_url, title=None): Inserts a new URL into the database and generates a short URL for it.

    1.4 Routes:

        1.4.1 /: The home page where users can shorten URLs.
        1.4.2 /dashboard: Displays a dashboard with analytics for the user's shortened URLs.
        1.4.3 /login: Handles user login.
        1.4.4 /signup: Handles user registration.
        1.4.5 /logout: Logs the user out.
        1.4.6 /profile: Displays the user's profile.
        1.4.7 /<short_url>: Redirects to the long URL corresponding to the given short URL and updates click statistics.

2. URL Shortening Process:

    2.1 Insertion:

        2.1.1 A new URL object is created and saved to the database.
        2.1.2 The id of this new object is then used to generate a unique short URL.
        2.1.3 The generated short URL is saved back to the database.

    2.2 Redirection:

        2.2.1 When a short URL is accessed, the corresponding long URL is fetched from the database.
        2.2.2 The request is then redirected to the long URL.
        2.2.3 Click statistics are updated.
